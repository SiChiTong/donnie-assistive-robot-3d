Donnie's model for 3D printer

#### Material: ####
PLA 500g 
Obs: We use PLA because its low retraction factor in large pieces.

#### Production: ####

.1. To print use the stl files in the stl_files folder.
.2. We use <a href="http://slic3r.org/">Slicer (1.2.9) </a> to slice and 3d printing the robot. 
Obs: We use the following configs on slicer:
Infill: 20%
Layer height: 0.3mm
Without support (parts that need support have it in the model).


#### Modification: ####
We use the Solidworks 2014 to modelling the robot. And the source files are in the solidworks directory.

#### Visualization: ####
You can visualize the 3D PDF files with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe Reader 9</a> or above. You just need to click in "Enable 3D View" when open the 3D PDF.
