# Donnie's Body

This repository has all files required to build the Donnie's body with a 3D printer.

## Required Material 

Donnie requires about 500g of PLA. We use PLA because its low retraction factor in large pieces.

## Production Phase

 1. The 3D printer requires the stl files, in the stl_files folder.  
 2. We use [Slicer (1.2.9)](http://slic3r.org/) to slice and 3d printing the robot. We use the following configs on slicer:
   * Infill: 20%; 
   * Layer height: 0.3mm;
   * Without support (parts that need support have it in the model).


## Modifying Donnie's Body

We used the Solidworks 2014 to model the robot. All the source files are in the solidworks directory.  

## Visualization

You can visualize the 3D PDF files with [Adobe Reader 9](http://www.adobe.com/) or above. You just need to click in "Enable 3D View" when open the 3D PDF.
